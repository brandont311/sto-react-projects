# Cellular Entropy Trajectory Dashboard

**STO Biotech Demo Suite** - Advanced cellular entropy analysis with real-time phase transition monitoring

## üî¨ Overview

This dashboard simulates cellular entropy evolution across different biological scenarios, providing critical insights into cellular health, stress responses, and therapeutic interventions. Using Shannon entropy calculations on discretized cellular state vectors, the system can detect early signs of cellular dysfunction before clinical symptoms appear.

## üî¨ STO Biotech Integration

This dashboard completes the **STO Biotech Demo Suite** alongside:
- **Protein Folding Accelerator**: Quantum-enhanced 3D protein simulations
- **Cancer Entropy Detector**: Early detection through cellular entropy analysis
- **QsP Energy Systems**: Hybrid data/energy storage with quantum coherence
- **Z-Factor Energy Core**: Thermodynamic optimization with performance monitoring

## üìä Entropy Interpretation Guide

### Phase Classifications
- **Stable Phase** (H < 1.0): Healthy cellular homeostasis
- **Drift Phase** (1.0 ‚â§ H < 2.0): Cellular stress response activated  
- **Collapse Phase** (H ‚â• 2.0): Critical dysfunction requiring intervention

### Scenario Patterns
- **Normal**: Flat entropy trajectory indicating healthy metabolism
- **Oxidative**: Steady entropy increase as antioxidant defenses fail
- **Drug Treatment**: Initial spike during drug uptake, then stabilization

## üåê Deployment

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
