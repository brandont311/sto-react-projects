## How to Explain the Demo

### **For Technical Audiences:**
"This demonstration uses Shannon entropy analysis to detect subtle changes in cellular organization patterns. By analyzing the distribution of cellular features over sliding time windows, we can identify increasing disorder (entropy) that precedes traditional biomarker detection by significant margins."

### **For Business/Medical Audiences:**
"Our AI system analyzes cellular data to detect early signs of cancer before traditional tests can identify them. The technology works by measuring 'cellular chaos' - when cells start behaving abnormally, there's increased randomness in their patterns that our system can detect weeks or months before current diagnostic methods."

### **Key Demo Points:**
1. **Upload or generate sample data** to show real-time analysis
2. **Adjust the alert threshold** to demonstrate sensitivity controls
3. **Point out the early detection timeline** - showing alerts before conventional detection
4. **Highlight the risk assessment** - automatic categorization of threat levels
5. **Emphasize the professional interface** - ready for clinical deployment
